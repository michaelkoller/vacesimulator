Vertex Color Coffee Props
=========================

DESCRIPTION
A set of low poly models with vertex colors. 
The package includes 5 different drinks which are created in a modular style so that you can use what you need.
A table and window are also included. Examples of standard and unlit lighting models are included but you can use your own shaders if desired.
These assets are great for a mobile project as there are no textures used.
